# Credit Card Fraud Detection using SQL

An SQL project for analyzing credit card transactions and detecting fraud using **PostgreSQL**. This project explores customer profiles, transaction behaviors, and fraud patterns through various SQL queries.

---

## Objective

To identify fraudulent transactions and uncover trends by analyzing:
- Customer details
- Credit card information
- Transaction behavior
- Fraud detection flags

---

## Technologies Used

- **PostgreSQL** for database management
- **SQL** for data analysis (Joins, Aggregations, Grouping, Filters)
- **pgAdmin** for running queries
- **CSV Files** for importing data

---

## Project Files

- **`dataset/`**: Contains the CSV files:
  - `card_base.csv` - Credit card data
  - `customer_base.csv` - Customer information
  - `transaction_base.csv` - Transaction records
  - `fraud_base.csv` - Fraud flag data
  
- **`create_tables.sql`**: Script for creating PostgreSQL tables from the CSV files.
- **`fraud_analysis_queries.sql`**: Contains SQL queries to analyze fraud patterns.

## Key Queries

1. **Customers with transactions over 49000**
2. **Premium credit card eligibility based on customer type**
3. **Credit limit range for fraudulent transaction customers**
4. **Average age of fraud-affected customers based on card type**
5. **Month with the highest number of fraudulent transactions**
6. **Customer with the highest non-fraudulent transaction value**

## Conclusion

This project utilizes SQL to detect fraudulent credit card transactions and provides actionable insights into transaction patterns and customer behavior. Itâ€™s a useful tool for detecting fraud in large datasets.
